# Geometry Calculator

A simple Python-based geometry calculator that can calculate the area of various shapes.

## Features

- **Square Area**: Calculates the area of a square given the side length.
- **Circle Area**: Calculates the area of a circle given the radius (uses `math.pi` for precision).
- **Triangle Area**: Calculates the area of a triangle given the base and height.
- **Ellipse Area**: Calculates the area of an ellipse given the major and minor axes (uses `numpy.pi` for precision).

Includes error handling for negative inputs.

## How to Run
